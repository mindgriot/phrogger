# Classic Arcade Game Clone
---
This [project](https://www.udacity.com/course/front-end-web-developer-nanodegree--nd001) was completed as part of Front-end Web Development course at Udacity.

To run this game open the index.html file in your browser.

## How to play
---
You can move the character with the arrow keys: up, down, left, right. One key press moves the character to the respective horizontal or vertical cell, e.g., pressing the "left" arrow key moves your character to the left, one cell horizontally.

The goal of the game is to move your character to the other side of the brick road safely to the water, at which point your character will be rewarded with 1 point; or, reach the other side of the brick road to a "goal-item", i.e., colored gem or key, at which point your character will be awarded 2 points.

If you are unsuccessful in maneuvering your character to the other side of the road safely and a water bug eats you. Your character will be returned to the bottom row on the game screen while still maintaining the same column location from which you were eaten. Your character will be deducted 1 point form their "score" total and 1 point will be added to their "deaths" total.

The game can be "paused" by pressing the "P" character on your keyboard, if the excitement of the vigorous game play causes you to re-think your strategy.

The game can also be "refreshed" to a new game, if you feel the water bugs are too vigorous in the defense of their pond.  

**Special Note:**
The game speed increases or decreases relative to how successful your character is at scoring points. Characters with which you play as are chosen randomly by the game. And "goal-items" along with their location in the water row of the game are also chosen randomly by the game.
